# CS4604 Labs
These labs will use relational database management systems (RDBMS). E.g. [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/), [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html).

MySQL is an open-source relational database management system. Its name is a combination of "My", the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter, and "SQL", the abbreviation for Structured Query Language.

MariaDB is a community-developed, commercially supported fork of the MySQL relational database management system, intended to remain free and open-source software under the GNU General Public License.

PostgreSQL is a free and open-source relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance. It was originally named POSTGRES, referring to its origins as a successor to the Ingres database developed at the University of California, Berkeley.

SQLite is an in-process library that implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine. The code for SQLite is in the public domain and is thus free for use for any purpose, commercial or private.
